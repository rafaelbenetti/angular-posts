# angular-posts

Since it was not clear if we should cache all data in the frontend I have used services with graphql and update state after iterations but when we change page or search, operations in frontend will be lost.

Note: I dont have professional experience with graphql, but I would love to learn it.

Next steps (TODOS):

- Move search to the graphql, is it possible in the provided API?
- Add unit tests (isolated, shallow and integration tests).
- Add empty states (page information when no data).
- Add confirmation dialog before deletion.

Here is a preview of the app:

![Alt text](preview/post-add.jpg?raw=true "Add post")

![Alt text](preview/post-details.jpg?raw=true "Preview post")

![Alt text](preview/post-edit.jpg?raw=true "Edit post")
