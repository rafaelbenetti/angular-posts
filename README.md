# angular-posts

Since it was not clear if we should cache all data in the frontend I have used services with graphql and update state after iterations but when we change page or search, operations in frontend will be lost.

Here is a preview of the app:

![Alt text](preview/posts-list.jpg?raw=true "Posts list")

![Alt text](preview/post-add.jpg?raw=true "Add post")

![Alt text](preview/post-details.jpg?raw=true "Preview post")

![Alt text](preview/post-edit.jpg?raw=true "Edit post")
